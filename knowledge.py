This is called a tropical year, and astronomers measure this from the March equinox.\nHowever, the Gregorian calendar has only 365 days in a year. If we didn't add a leap day on February 29 nearly every four years, we would lose almost six hours off our calendar every single year. After only 100 years, our calendar would be off by around 24 days!"]
